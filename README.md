Generative AI can be a powerful assistant for all digital workers, including web application developers. With the rapid development of generative AI tools, it’s important for web developers to understand how these tools work and how they can be leveraged for code writing, validation, and testing. In this course, Joe Casabona—college-accredited course developer and founder of Creator Courses—covers what generative AI is, some common tools, and what they mean for web developers. Explore common use cases, learn about other recommended courses, and find out how to use AI tools to write, refactor, and test PHP.
